   For more details have a look at :doc:`t3start:installing-extensions` or
   :ref:`t3start:install-extension-with-composer`.

Next: Importing picture terms
=============================
You will need to configure templates for the picture vendors and licenses used in your project.

To get you started, the extension already provides a set of commonly used picture terms.
We recommend that you :ref:`import these into your database <import-terms-database>`.
